## This is a dog project.

## Descritpion:
Developed a web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a non-profit organization called Canine Assistants. The purpose of the web app was for the dog to communicate with its owner and for help if needed. Me and my team decided to have binary questions displayed based off of two images. As the dog touches the screen visual, auditory, and text alerts are sent to the device and external devices. For example, one image, if clicked, calls a specific number through Skype to alert other people that the dogâ€™s owner is in danger. However, other images can be meant for the necessities of the dog.
